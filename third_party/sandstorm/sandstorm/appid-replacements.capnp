@0xa53cae3f717a1676;
# This file is used to recover from lost or stolen app keys.
#
# If you are an app developer and you have lost access to your key or suspect it may have been
# compromised, do the following:
# 1. Generate a new key using `vagrant-spk keygen`. The new key ID will be printed.
# 2. Use `vagrant-spk getkey <key-id> > backup.key` to make a backup copy of the key. Put
#    `backup.key` somewhere safe! Of course, do NOT make this file public!
# 3. Add an entry to `appIdReplacementList` below with `original` being your old key ID (app ID)
#    and `replacement` being the new key ID (as printed when you generated it).
# 4. PGP-sign your git commit using the `-S` flag, using the same PGP key you used to sign older
#    versions of your app as published to the app market. (If you can't do this, we'll need to
#    verify your identity in some other way.)
# 5. Submit a pull request.
#
# Things you should NOT do:
# * Do NOT change sandstorm-pkgdef.capnp to the new key. Once Sandstorm is updated with your PR,
#   the spk tool will automatically use the new key where appropriate.
# * Do NOT update your `pgpSignature` file. The signature should still assert ownership of the
#   original app ID.
# * Do NOT update links to the app market or anywhere else that incorporate the app ID. Your app ID
#   is not changing; only the signing key is changing.

$import "/capnp/c++.capnp".namespace("sandstorm::spk");

struct AppIdReplacement {
  # Specifies that packages signed by the app ID specified in `replacement` shall henceforth be
  # treated as if they had instead be signed by `original`. Hence, packages signed with the
  # replacement key will be accepted as upgrades to the original and will be displayed as if
  # they had the original ID.

  original @0 :Text;
  # The original App ID, in text format for convenience. This is the canonical ID for this app,
  # and will remain so going forward.

  replacement @1 :Text;
  # The replacement App ID, in text format for convenience. Packages signed with this ID will be
  # treated as if they are signed with the original ID. Omit this to revoke an ID with no
  # replacement.
  #
  # Note: Do NOT distribute any packages signed with the new ID until a Sandstorm release has gone
  # out with your app ID replacement, otherwise people who install the app too early will be unable
  # to update it.

  revokeExceptPackageIds @2 :List(Text);
  # A list of package IDs (in text format for convenience) which were signed with the original
  # key and are known to be authentic versions of this app. All other packages signed with the
  # original key will be presumed malicious and rejected.
  #
  # Only specify this if the original key may have been compromised. If the key was merely lost
  # (e.g. storage was destroyed with no backup) then there is no need to revoke the old key.
  # In this case, omit this field (making it null).
